this simply integrates a reaction network consisting of species
equations, with no thermodynamics evolution, so we don't need an EOS
here.


We use LAPACK for the matrix solve.  We are using the general solve here.

Modules that must be loaded before compiling:
craype-accel-nvidia35 (for Cray compiler only, will also load cudatoolkit)
cudatoolkit
PrgEnv-pgi or PrgEnv-cray

It is recommended that you swap out to the latest environment for the compiler, e.g.
$ module swap cce/8.3.4 cce/8.3.12
$ module swap pgi/14.2.0 pgi/15.3.0

Recommendations for OpenACC development based on developing this code:

+ Compilers have trouble with module arrays that are parameters.  Instead,
  rewrite them as alloctable arrays and, if necessary, add an initialization
  function.

+ Compilers do not like Fortran character types.  Avoid them.  Character
  variables can be rewritten as integers to achieve the same goal.

+ Be wary of multiple exits (multple returns, stops, etc) in OpenACC regions.

+ Avoid write or print statements in OpenACC regions.
